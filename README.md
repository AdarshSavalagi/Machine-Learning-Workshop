# Machine Learning Algorithms Lab (BCIL504)

## Course Type: Practical

### Agenda
This workshop is designed to provide hands-on experience with essential machine learning algorithms. Through a series of structured lab sessions, participants will gain practical knowledge in implementing and evaluating various machine learning models. The focus will be on understanding the core concepts, writing Python scripts, and working on real-world datasets.
