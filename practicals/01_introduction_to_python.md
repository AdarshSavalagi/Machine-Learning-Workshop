- Get familiar with Python syntax and basic programming concepts
- Introduction to essential libraries for machine learning
  - NumPy for numerical operations
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with Python is a plus but not required

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

#### Installing Python
To begin with, you'll need to install Python on your computer. Python is available for all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

1. **Download Python**: Go to the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Choose the Latest Version**: Download the latest stable version of Python 3.x by clicking on the appropriate download link for your operating system.
3. **Run the Installer**:
   - **Windows**: Run the downloaded `.exe` file. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH" before clicking "Install Now."
   - **macOS**: Run the `.pkg` file. You may need to authorize the installation with your administrator password.
   - **Linux**: Python 3.x is usually installed by default. If not, you can install it using the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python3
     ```

#### Setting Up Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is a popular tool for writing and running Python code, especially in data science and machine learning.

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and install Jupyter Notebook using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```
2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Once installed, you can start Jupyter Notebook by running:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter interface.

#### Creating a Virtual Environment
A virtual environment allows you to create an isolated space on your computer where you can install and manage libraries without affecting other projects.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Run the following command to create a new virtual environment named `ml-lab`:
   ```bash
   python -m venv ml-lab
   ```
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - **Windows**: 
     ```bash
     ml-lab\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source ml-lab/bin/activate
     ```
   After activation, your command prompt or terminal should show the name of your virtual environment in parentheses, indicating that it is active.

#### Installing Essential Libraries
With your virtual environment activated, install the libraries necessary for machine learning:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

These libraries will help you with numerical operations, data manipulation, data visualization, and implementing machine learning algorithms.

### 2. Python Basics
Once your environment is set up, you'll get familiar with Python basics.

- **Data Types**: Understand different data types in Python (int, float, str, list, tuple, dict, set).
- **Control Structures**: Learn about if-else statements, loops (for, while), and functions.
- **Working with Libraries**: Import and use external libraries in your Python scripts.
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import pandas as pd
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  ```

### 3. Introduction to Essential Libraries
- **NumPy**: Create arrays, perform mathematical operations, and manipulate array data.
  ```python
  arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  print(arr + 1)
  ```
- **Pandas**: Load and manipulate data using DataFrames.
  ```python
  data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
  print(data.head())
  ```
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Plot data for visualization.
  ```python
  plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
  plt.show()
  ```
- **Scikit-learn**: Introduction to machine learning algorithms.
  ```python
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  ```

### 4. Hands-On Exercise
- Write a Python script to load a dataset, perform basic data analysis, and plot a graph.
  - Load a dataset using Pandas
  - Perform basic data exploration (mean, median, standard deviation)
  - Plot a histogram or scatter plot using Matplotlib
